Open source tooling for engineering problems

The plan is to include a number of python algorithms for typical engineering problems.

Planned methods/algorithms
==========================

Structural engineering
- Finite Element analysis (2D)
- Finite Element analysis (3D)

Form Finding (cable-nets and grid-shells)
- Dynamic Relaxation (3D)
- Force Density Method (3D)

Meshing
- Delaunay Triangulation

Physics
- Particle Spring Systems (2D)
- Particle Spring Systems (3D)
