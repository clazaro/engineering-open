================
Open source tooling for engineering problems

The plan is to include a number of python algorithms for typical engineering problems. Initially, the algorithms might primarily be aimed on structural engineering problems, but the idea is to include all algorithms to help engineers perform their tasks.

Mission
=======

The mission of engineering open is simple: To make engineering algorithms open source and therefore usable and checkable by anyone. 

In many cases engineers base their judgement on software that they trust without actually knowing what the software does in its internals. The well-trained engineer will check his or her calculations against standard cases, expectation or simplified models. However, with software becoming more complicated and time decreasing for design, many engineers seems to blindly trust their calculations. Therefore, why not let the community check those algorithms?

Disclaimer
==========

If you are expecting software with a nice and easy user interface or advanced capabilities, sorry, this is the wrong place. We hope that in the future people will pick up and develop these features and capabilities (maybe you?), but at the moment some algorithms and implementations are pretty basic.

Planned methods/algorithms
